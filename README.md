# 🎓 Online Examination Grading System (C Project)

A modular C-based project that simulates an *automated online exam evaluation system*.  
The system accepts MCQ responses, compares them with an answer key, calculates score & percentage, assigns grades, and displays the final result — similar to modern online test platforms.

This project is created as part of *Project 6: Online Examination Grading System* using *Arrays, Loops, Conditionals, and Structures*.
